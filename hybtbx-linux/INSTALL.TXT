To install the toolbox, you should follow the following procedure:

- Extract the zip file to a directory with writing permissions

- Run MATLAB

- Add the directory and the /utils folder to $MATLABPATH.
  (Go to the menu FILE/SET PATH from the MATLAB Command Window, and then PATH/ADD TO PATH 
   from the Path Browser window)

Make sure that the \utils directory has write permissions and that the
.h and .dll files are not read-only.

Make also sure that the HYSDEL executable in @mld/private/ has execution permissions.

A user's guide is available in PDF in the /manual subdirectory.
Several demos are in the /demos directory.

To be able to generate mex files you should have a C-compiler 
compatible with MATLAB (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 TM, or the free
compiler and mex interface MINGW/GNUMEX).

The software is compatible with MATLAB >= R2009a. Some functions do not work on earlier versions of MATLAB.

The Model Predictive Control Toolbox for MATLAB should be installed for
using certain parts of the Hybrid Toolbox.

If you plan to use Ilog CPLEX with version <=11.2 with the Hybrid Toolbox, you should 
copy ..\ILOG\CPLEX91\BIN\X86_WIN32\CPLEX91.DLL in a visible 
path (e.g.: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32). The precompiled mex file CPLEXMEX.DLL 
was compiled for CPLEX 9.1. If you have an earlier version of Cplex,
try renaming CPLEXxx.DLL to CPLEX91.DLL. If you plan to use CPLEX through the CPLEXINT mex interface, you should probably 
do the same and rename CPLEXxx.DLL into CPLEX112.DLL, which is the version CPLEXINT 
was compiled for. No issue if you are using IBM CPLEX version >12.0, whose installation comes with a MATLAB interface.

A free academic license to use the MILP/MIQP solver of Gurobi (very efficient for hybrid MPC) can be downloaded from http://www.gurobi.com. 

----------
For WIN64 users: some additional files must be downloaded. To do this, after you install the toolbox download required mex files from

http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/hybrid/toolbox/files/win64mex/

(mex compiled for R2012a should also work in later versions of MATLAB)

Some users reported that Windows SDK must be installed to have mex files working successfully.
